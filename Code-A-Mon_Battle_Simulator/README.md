# Code-A-Mon Battle Simulator

This project is a Java-based battle system where a simulated `Code-A-Mon` Trainer battles with `Code-A-Mon` creatures, each having different types and moves, similar to the mechanics of PokÃ©mon. The system is built with modular components for trainers, battles, and different `Code-A-Mon` types.

This project was completed with the purpose of learning, understanding, and then utilizing a minimum of 2 Design Patterns.  
___
### Design Patterns Used

1.  **Factory Pattern**: The Factory pattern is heavily utilized in the `CodeAMonFactory` module. This design pattern allows the creation of different types of `Code-A-Mon` objects without specifying the exact class that will be instantiated. By encapsulating the object creation logic in a factory, the code becomes more flexible and scalable, making it easy to add new `Code-A-Mon` types or modify existing ones without affecting the client code.
    
2.  **Mediator Pattern**: The `CycleMediator` module uses the Mediator pattern to manage interactions between different components, such as battles, weather conditions, and game cycles. The Mediator pattern centralizes communication between components, reducing the dependencies between them. This results in a more maintainable and loosely coupled system, where changes in one component don't directly affect others.
    
3.  **Strategy Pattern**: The Strategy pattern is implemented in the `TrainerFactory` module, where different strategies for training and battling with `Code-A-Mon` are encapsulated in separate classes (e.g., `ComputerTrainer`, `PlayerTrainer`). The Strategy pattern allows the behavior of the trainers to be selected at runtime, enabling flexibility in how trainers interact with their `Code-A-Mon` and engage in battles.
    

### How They Work Together

These design patterns work together to create a cohesive and flexible system for the `CodeAMon Battle System`. The Factory pattern ensures that the creation of `Code-A-Mon` is centralized and modular, making it easy to integrate with other parts of the system. The Mediator pattern manages the complex interactions between different game components, ensuring that the game cycle, weather, and battles are coordinated effectively. The Strategy pattern allows different trainers to adopt various behaviors during training and battles, providing flexibility and enhancing the game's dynamics. Together, these patterns contribute to a modular, maintainable, and scalable architecture, where each component is decoupled and can evolve independently.
